# Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques
This project aims to evaluate various supervised machine learning models for predicting bankruptcy of private firms using their financial information as features.
The performance of different models, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (both Linear Kernel and SVM) were evaluated using various performance metrics. 

The dataset used in this study is highly imbalanced, with only a small percentage of companies going bankrupt. To address this issue, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to balance the dataset. 
Additionally, cross-validation of hyper parameters, feature selection and dimension reduction techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were employed to improve the model performance.
